# Libzy
An app to narrow down a large Spotify library into suggested albums, based on the genre/familiarity preferences of your current mood.

## To-Do
- flesh out architecture
- incorporate unit testing
- clean up gradle.build
- improve button styling, make responsive to presses
- make "Connect Spotify" button on-brand
- decide on minimum and target SDK
- determine whether .arr modules should be added to git or .gitignore
- add a modal popup to install spotify if it's not detected on the device when necessary
- document all code
- use spotify app remote to provide song queuing as alternative feature to album search
- make app icon / logo
- add splash screen to LaunchActivity
- test auth when user doesn't have spotify downloaded (should bring to download page, use AuthenticationClient)
- figure out of I should use something other than AppCompatActivity if I'm not using the action bar
- if spotifyAuth() doesn't find spotify on the device, redirect to download page
- find a better name for FilterActivity
- sort out all errors/warnings in debugger
- if always-empty auth problem, persists just use webview or browser auth
- rename redirect URI host to spotify-auth
- define button callbacks in layout xml instead of Activity code
- define gradle version constants
- remove unused dependencies from build.gradle, such as kotlinx and dagger-android
- debug "pending vsync event" warning
- determine whether my project actually needs dependency injection (are there any nested dependencies? are there any shared dependencies?)
- create a develop branch and start using feature/bugfix branches
- check my kotlin syntax / practices (e.g. am I writing constructors correctly?)
- figure out what to do if SpotifyRepository tries to make a call with an expired access token (spotify auth activity must be universally accessible)
- review the [Android Architecture Samples](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/master) for guidance
- apply a Google or JetBrains style guide
- maybe use adamint's wrapper for auth if it can do it as elegantly as spotify sdk, because then access tokens can always be in the backend
- add a timer for access token expiration with a callback that uses spotify auth sdk then returns to whatever activity user was in
- figure out how to auto-refresh the spotify token (may need a server for spotify's Authorization Code Flow)
- talk to adamint team to see if there's an alternative to requiring `exclude 'META-INF/*.kotlin_module'`
- change "Hey There!" message in SelectGenresActivity to dynamically-decided "Good Evening!" or "Good morning!" or "Good afternoon!"
- rename colors to something more applicable (and remove unused colors)
- determine proper parent theme
- add version constants to build.gradle
- remove unnecessary logs
- complete all inline TODOs
- remove unused resources
- replaced one-parameter lambdas with "it" when appropriate
- use jetpack navigation component
- update all UI and styling
- use a RecyclerView for the genres ChipGroup?
- better constraints for bottom nav bar and horizontal orientation, especially w/ genre chip group 
- handle UI rotations
- remove placeholder chips from SelectGenreActivity layout, because real loading chips are added programmatically (and delete where I programmatically remove them)
- decide on consistent view ID naming convention (either camel case or snake case, because used as both ID and class instance) ORRR just use view binding
- fix gradient not appearing since I updated to Material Theme
- just go through Android developer docs in order
- center genre option chips
- try Dan's mockup font to see how it compares to varela round
- handle failed API calls
- show number of results on each genre option chip
- fix bug in SelectGenresActivity where you can't scroll after changing orientation
- make bottom of UI layout relative to nav bar
- sort order selector for BrowseResultsActivity (alphabetical, num albums)
- labeled scroll bar for BrowseResultsActivity
- ability to collapse a genre in BrowseResultsActivity
- understand and tweak each xml attribute of nested RecyclerView concoction
- change genresGroupedByAlbums to a DTO?
- use Kotlin's Flow API for getting Spotify data?
- use Android Coroutines Extension
- instead of using Spotify API wrapper, call it myself using Retrofit, following similar pattern as GithubBrowserSample in android-architecture-components-samples (gives a good model for using Dagger 2 as well)
- use fragments?
- cache user library info using Room (determine when I would want to use SharedPreferences instead)
- think about performance in every line of code
- add more color types to main app theme styling
- use dimens constants for everything in layout
- add splash screen for LaunchActivity
- make a more exciting "Connect Spotify" screen... maybe add welcome images and descriptions of waht the app can do and what we use your Spotify for?
- figure out how to constrain top and bottom to nav/status bars instead of screen edge
- move android:fitsSystemWindows to the main app theme
- *********** use adamint update to push new access token to Spotify API wrapper via SharedPreferencesListener

## Planned Features
- ability to hide recently played genres or top genres, to try something new
- integration with spotify remote SDK to play/queue results directly from Libzy
- ability to remove saved albums from library directly from Libzy
- ability to remove album's association with a certain genre so it not longer appears in results for that genre
- ability to visit the Spotify page for an album without playing it
- separate page for individual albums, showing genre data (with options to browse those genres or add them to your selected categories?) & other info available from API like audio analysis of tracks
- support for searching by individual tracks instead of only albums
- display 1-3 sample albums for each genre in the list on SelectGenreActivity
- list currently selected genres at top of SelectGenreActivity
- "discover more from this genre" button to the right of the genre header in BrowseAlbumsActivity (brings them to an activity similar to BrowseAlbums but with one vertical scrolling grid list of albums, and maybe a description of the genre pulled from google/wikipedia below the genre header)
