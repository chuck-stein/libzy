# Libzy
An app to narrow down a large Spotify library into suggested albums, based on the genre/familiarity preferences of your current mood.

## To-Do
- flesh out architecture
- incorporate unit testing
- clean up gradle.build
- improve button styling, make responsive to presses
- make "Connect Spotify" button on-brand
- decide on minimum and target SDK
- determine whether .arr modules should be added to git or .gitignore
- add a modal popup to install spotify if it's not detected on the device when necessary
- document all code
- use spotify app remote to provide song queuing as alternative feature to album search
- make app icon / logo
- add splash screen to LaunchActivity
- test auth when user doesn't have spotify downloaded (should bring to download page, use AuthenticationClient)
- figure out of I should use something other than AppCompatActivity if I'm not using the action bar
- if spotifyAuth() doesn't find spotify on the device, redirect to download page
- find a better name for FilterActivity
- sort out all errors/warnings in debugger
- if always-empty auth problem, persists just use webview or browser auth
- rename redirect URI host to spotify-auth
- define button callbacks in layout xml instead of Activity code
- define gradle version constants
- remove unused dependencies from build.gradle, such as kotlinx and dagger-android
- debug "pending vsync event" warning
- determine whether my project actually needs dependency injection (are there any nested dependencies? are there any shared dependencies?)
- create a develop branch and start using feature/bugfix branches
- check my kotlin syntax / practices (e.g. am I writing constructors correctly?)
- figure out what to do if SpotifyRepository tries to make a call with an expired access token (spotify auth activity must be universally accessible)
- review the [Android Architecture Samples](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/master) for guidance
- apply a Google or JetBrains style guide
- maybe use adamint's wrapper for auth if it can do it as elegantly as spotify sdk, because then access tokens can always be in the backend
- add a timer for access token expiration with a callback that uses spotify auth sdk then returns to whatever activity user was in
- figure out how to auto-refresh the spotify token (may need a server for spotify's Authorization Code Flow)
- talk to adamint team to see if there's an alternative to requiring `exclude 'META-INF/*.kotlin_module'`
- change "Hey There!" message in SelectGenresActivity to dynamically-decided "Good Evening!" or "Good morning!" or "Good afternoon!"
- rename colors to something more applicable
- determine proper parent theme
- add version constants to build.gradle
- remove unnecessary logs
- complete all inline TODOs
